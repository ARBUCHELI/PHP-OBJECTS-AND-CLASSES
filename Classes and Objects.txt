# CLASSES AND OBJECTS
---------------------

* Introduction
--------------
In our PHP programs so far, we’ve relied on data types built into the language—we’ve used String, Number and Boolean data types directly and saved data in variables. We’ve also used 
Arrays to organize multiple pieces of data within a single structure.

But sometimes the data types built into the language aren’t enough! Just as we can write custom functions and not depend exclusively on PHP’s built-in functions, we can write custom data 
types.

In order to define our own data types, we’ll think of the general qualities our user-defined types should have. We’ll create a class —a blueprint defining the related data and functions 
that should be bundled together inside each instance of this new type. Once the class is defined, we can create specific instances of it—as many as we want! These instances of the class 
are called objects.

Instructions
Imagine we were creating a Pet class within our program. What sorts of data and functionality should every pet have? Spend some time thinking about this yourself and then feel free to 
scroll down and look at some of our ideas.

We imagined that pets should have data like their name, color, age. We also thought they might have some functionality like eating and cuddling.

* What are Classes?
-------------------
In the previous exercise, we asked you to imagine a class for pets. Let’s see how we would actually create a PHP Pet class.

To define a Pet class, we use the class keyword followed by the class name (typically title cased in PHP) and curly brackets:

class Pet {

}

Within the curly brackets, we can add properties, which define the data each object of the class will contain. The syntax is similar to how we define variables:

class Pet {
  public $name, $color;
}

Note: The public keyword has to do with something called visibility. We’ll discuss this in depth later in the lesson.

index.php
---------
<?php

class Beverage {
  public 
    $color,
    $opacity,
    $temperature;
}

* Instantiating
---------------
In the previous exercise, we created a class (a blueprint) for any pet we may want to make. But we didn’t make any actual, individual pet objects. Since objects are specific instances of 
a class, the process of creating them is called instantiation.

In PHP, objects are instantiated using the new keyword followed by the class name and parentheses.

$very_good_dog = new Pet();

We now have our first object, $very_good_dog. We interact with an object’s properties using the object operator (->) followed by the name of the property (without the dollar sign, $).

We can use this syntax to assign values to object properties:

$very_good_dog->name = "Lassie";

We can also use it to access the existing value of object properties:

echo $very_good_dog->name; # Prints "Lassie"

index.php
---------
<?php
class Beverage {
  public $temperature, $color, $opacity;
}

$tea = new Beverage();

$tea->temperature = "hot";

echo $tea->temperature;
